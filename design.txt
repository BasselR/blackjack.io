Client will only have power to SEE their current hand (for now)
All other information, as well as deck / hand manipulation will occur on the server


Regarding aces:

By default, aces will be "big aces" (worth 11 points).
If a player's hit request would result in them busting, then their hand is searched for big aces.
If a big ace is found, it is converted into a small ace (worth 1), and play continues. Otherwise, player busts.

This can be done by "searching" their hand for a big ace when needed, or alternatively (more efficiently ?), by
constantly keeping track of how many big aces a player's hand contains, and deducting from there when needed.


Regarding game end:
(x) If someone stands, the other player can keep hitting until they stand or bust.
(x) If someone hits 21, they automatically stand.
(x) If both players stand, game ends and card showdown occurs.
If someone busts, the other player does not know. They are given one final turn. If they bust, game is tied.
If not, they win.
