Client will only have power to SEE their current hand (for now)
All other information, as well as deck / hand manipulation will occur on the server

Regarding aces:

By default, aces will be "big aces" (worth 11 points).
If a player's hit request would result in them busting, then their hand is searched for big aces.
If a big ace is found, it is converted into a small ace (worth 1), and play continues. Otherwise, player busts.

This can be done by "searching" their hand for a big ace when needed, or alternatively (more efficiently ?), by
constantly keeping track of how many big aces a player's hand contains, and deducting from there when needed.


Regarding game end:
[x] If someone stands, the other player can keep hitting until they stand or bust.
[x] If both players stand, game ends and card showdown occurs.
[x] If someone busts, they appear to stand. Opponent is given a final turn. If they bust, tie game. If not, they win.
[x] Support rematch (within room) and switch who goes first each game. Keep tally of score between room's players.
